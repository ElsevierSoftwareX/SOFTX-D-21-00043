### Development flow
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Reporting bugs
>You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public.<br/>
>Check the [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) to see how to report security issues or vulnerabilities.

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors.<br/>
Check the issue tracker to see if it has already been reported, and if not, open a new issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens

### Submitting changes
If you want to to propose changes to the codebase, you will have to make a pull request:
- Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`
- Make your changes
- Create the pull request

Remember to use a coding style (indentation, formatting) consistent with the rest of the project.

### Licensing
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project BSD-3-Clause License.
